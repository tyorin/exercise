// Are promises always resolved asynchronously?

// The Promises/A+ spec declares that promises MUST fire their resolution/rejection

// function on the same turn of the event loop that they are created on.  This is very important because it eliminates the possibility of execution order
// varying and resulting in indeterminate outcomes.

// You can expect that the functions passed to the "then" method of a promise willbe
// called on the NEXT turn of the event loop.

// Task

// In this lesson, we are going to prove to ourselves that this is the case by
// writing a script that does the following:

// 1. Create a promise using the "Q" library
// 2. Pass console.log to the "then" method of our promise
// *3. Resolve the promise with a parameter "SECOND"
// 4. Print "FIRST" to the console using console.log

// *Do this synchronsouly and NOT in a setTimeout as was the case in previous lessons

// Your script will pass and show you that despite the promise being resolved synchronously,
// the provided function is not executed until the next turn of the event loop.

// Thus, you should see "FIRST", "SECOND"

//    `promise-it-wont-hurt run program.js`.
//  » To verify your program, run: `promise-it-wont-hurt verify program.js`.

//    `promise-it-wont-hurt help`.



// console.log('FIRST');
// console.log('SECOND');



var q = require('q')
  , deferred = q.defer();

deferred.promise.then(console.log);
deferred.resolve("SECOND");
console.log("FIRST");
